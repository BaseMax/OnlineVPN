# OnlineVPN
The OnlineVPN is a web-based platform designed in Python that provide you a home page that you are able to enter any page URL that you are willing to check/watch, and you enter a list of domain or subdomains that you are willing to change and forward, then it will send a request to your page from the server and act like a proxy.
